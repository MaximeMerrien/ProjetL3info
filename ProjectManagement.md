### 3. Inventories Management - *SAMMANI Axel & MERRIEN Maxime*
  
One of the most essential features in a 2D role-playing based adventure game is indeed the managment of several items, weather it is equipments, consumables, quest rewards, and so on.
  The way we are managing our system is fairly simple.
  
  On the first side, we have a main inventory, useful for the storage of various items.

  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2" align="center">1</td>
    <td align="center">Importing assets - Inventory Master</td>

  <tr>
    <td rowspan="1" align="center">4</td>
    <td align="center">Display of different recipes linked to the item and the recipe to create it</td>
  </tr>

On another part, we found interesting to implement a craft system, where the player can create new items, thanks to many recipes.

Last but not least, we added a hotbar, in order to allow the player to quickly select the item he wants to use.
