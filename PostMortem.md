## How to build
If you want to build our project, just download it there : https://github.com/NicolasHubs/ProjetL3info.git, launch **Unity** and you're ready to go !

## Tests
All of our tests were realized in the game at runtime. We played like a "normal" player would and looked for what was missing/didn't work.

## What's left
Several functionnalities or aspects have yet to be implemented.

One of them has to be the design of the inventories of the player. It needs to be more in tune with our overall game design.

We also wanted to add a minimap for the player, and a shop as well.

In addition to that, we thought it'd be nice if the player could destroy the planet, and play with other people !

## Adding code
To facilitate the work for other people, we commented a great part of what we did.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Note that we used assets from the Unity Store. These parts will likely not be commented out.
